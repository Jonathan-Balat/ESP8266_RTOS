Getting started
To make use of this project, simply install the following software/programs
- Visual Studio Code
- PlatformIO plugin (For C development)
- Python (For pytests)

Program Flow
The main code consists of RTOS Tasks that are run to initialize peripherals. Currently, the tasks are:
    - UART: For serial communications
    - LED: For board status
    - WIFI: For TCP communications.

Wifi Comms format:
The Command Frame used to communicate the following devices is as follows:

    |   Label       |   ByteIndex   |            Remarks            |
    |  StartByte    |      [0]      |  0xBD (Constant)              |
    |  CMD_ID       |      [1]      |  0x0 - 0xFF                   |
    | PayloadLength |      [3]      |  Varies according to CMD_DATA |
    |  CMD_Data     |      [3:N]    |  Formats according to CMD_ID  |

Minimally, the Command Frame should be size of 2 Bytes, where the first byte should be the StartByte Constant (0xBD). Otherwise, this is considered invalid and the program will reject the message received.

CMD_ID:
Commands are flexible and can be assigned from 0x0 to 0xFF. Current program shows examples of Commands implemented.

CMD_ID  - 0 (Sum)
Format: [StartByte, 0x0, PayloadLength (0 to N), N, N-1, ..., 0] computes for the total sum of the provided N-Bytes received.

CMD_ID  - 1 (Blink)
Format: [StartByte, 0x0, 0x3 (Constant), OnTime (ms), OffTime (ms), NumOfRepeats]
Triggers the LED to blink NumOfRepeats-times with provided OnTime and OffTime.
